# High Performance Tool (Windows)

High-Performance-Tool is an application designed to optimize system performance by accessing and enabling hidden power plans in Windows. This tool allows users to maximize hardware resource usage, such as CPU and GPU, for better performance, especially when running resource-intensive applications or gaming. By utilizing power plans not visible by default, this tool helps enhance system performance without the need for manual configuration.
